-College history, mission, and vision
Mahatma Gandhi Higher Secondary School (formerly Mahatma Gandhi Junior College), Baisinga is a shining symbol of knowledge and progress in Mayurbhanj. Established in 1988 as Mahatma Gandhi Mahavidyalaya, the institution was born from the aspirations of the local community. What began as a dream soon transformed into reality, inspiring generations of learners.
Initially functioning from Munilal High School, the institution received government concurrence in 1989 with 128 seats in +2 Arts and 64 seats in +2 Science. As the demand for quality education grew, the Arts capacity expanded to 256 seats. A +3 wing was introduced in 1993, accommodating 128 students. But in 2008, the +3 wing was separated from +2 (Junior College) as per Govt. order no 29412/HE dated 18/05/2001 and GB resolution no. 26 dated 25/02/2008. Now the institution has been renamed as Mahatma Gandhi Junior College, Baisinga and subsequently named as Mahatma Gandhi Higher Secondary School, Baisinga as per DHSE letter no 5276 dated 26.12.2017 and letter no 9635 dated 13.11.2018.
The school offers a well-rounded curriculum, providing compulsory subjects like English and MIL (Odia or Hindi), with a variety of optional subjects in +2 Arts, including History, Political Science, Economics, Logic, Education, Psychology, Sanskrit, and Odia. For Science students, the school offers Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology. 
Set amidst the lush beauty of Baisinga, MGHSS is located just 20 kilometers from Balasore, 12 kilometers from Betnoti Railway Station, and 500 metres from Baisinga Bus Stand, with Baripada only 40 kilometers away. 
The spacious campus features a large playground, science laboratories and a well-stocked library. Essential facilities such as the Principal's Chamber, Office Room, SAMS Room, Examination Section, Admission Section, and Staff Common Room ensure smooth administrative operations.
